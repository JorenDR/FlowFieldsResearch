# FlowFieldsResearch
This project is a research into Flow Fields, how they are built and how they are used.
The project uses the framework we used in the first year of Game Development at DAE.

At startup, you are greeted with a blank screen. 
Left-clicking anywhere will build a flow field towards that point.
Right-clicking will spawn a group of agents who move towards the given point.
Space clears all agents from the program.
